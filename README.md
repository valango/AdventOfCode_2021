# Advent Of Code @2021

My [adventofcode.com](https://adventofcode.com) '21 adventures.<br />
I've done that before: [AoC '20](https://github.com/valango/adventOfCode).

## Diary

* `day 01:` Joined the races, with just 16 hrs of delay 🐌🐌🐌
* `day 02:` So far, its all trivial. Joined by afternoon, actual time 23min.
* `day 03:` Actually simple stuff, but it really took some focussing (101min).
* `day 04:` A nice one. Some time was lost for misreading the input format.

## Track record
My ranking placements and final times for puzzle 1 and 2 by days.<br >
**Others** is number of solvers of both puzzles and **Just 1** of those who had solved
only the first one, taken from
[global stats](https://adventofcode.com/2021/stats) when I completed.

## Usage
After installing with npm or yarn, just type `./run` or `node .` and the puzzles from the most recent
day will run.

The following command line parameters apply:
* an integer: number for a day (several numbers may be supplied);
* -0, -1, -2: use main dataset or some with higher number (default: all datasets).
* 'a': all - puzzles for existing days will be solved (overrides dy numbers if any);
