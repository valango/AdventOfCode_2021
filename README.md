# Advent Of Code @2021

My [adventofcode.com](https://adventofcode.com) adventures.

the files named like `day_xx.js` contain daily quiz solutions as they were born -
quick and dirty - with no afterwards-makeup.
Sometimes a `day_xx.nice.js` is there, though.

### Diary

* `day 01:` joined the races, with just 16 hrs of delay 🐌🐌🐌
* `day 02:` so far, its all trivial. Joined by afternoon, actual time 23min.

### Track record
My ranking placements and final times for puzzle 1 and 2 by days. The '_%_'
column shows the ratio of people done w both puzzles, from all participants,
by the time I made it. Of course the time zone difference gives us
the Europeans (and Africans, too) an unfair advantage here. 😜

| day | Rank 1 | Time 1 | Rank 2 | Time 2 | % |
| ---: | ---: | :---: | ---: | :---: |---: |
| 1 | 87733 | 16:09:30 | 77832 | 16:26:49 | |
| 2 | 58863 | 16:09:30 | 55421 | 16:26:49 | |
