# Advent Of Code @2021

My [adventofcode.com](https://adventofcode.com) '21 adventures.<br />
I've done that before: [AoC '20](https://github.com/valango/adventOfCode).

### Diary

* `day 01:` Joined the races, with just 16 hrs of delay 🐌🐌🐌
* `day 02:` So far, its all trivial. Joined by afternoon, actual time 23min.
* `day 03:` Actually simple stuff, but it really took some focussing (101min).
* `day 04:` A nice one. Some time was lost for misreading the input format.

### Track record
My ranking placements and final times for puzzle 1 and 2 by days. The '_%_'
column shows the ratio of people done w both puzzles, from all participants,
by the time I made it. Of course the time zone difference gives us
the Europeans (and Africans, too) an unfair advantage here. 😜

| day | Rank 1 | Time 1 | Rank 2 | Time 2 | % |
| ---: | ---: | :---: | ---: | :---: |---: |
| 4 | 4087 | 00:41:37 | 4896 | 01:06:05 | |
