# Advent Of Code '2021

My [adventofcode.com](https://adventofcode.com) adventures.<br />
Older ones: [2020](https://github.com/valango/adventOfCode),
[2015](https://github.com/valango/AdventOfCode_2015).

## Diary

* `day 01:` Joined the races, with just 16 hrs of delay 🐌🐌🐌
* `day 02:` So far, its all trivial. Joined by afternoon, actual time 23min.
* `day 03:` Actually simple stuff, but it really took some focussing (101min).
* `day 04:` A nice one. Some time was lost for misreading the input format.
* `day 05:` Simple, but... man, I hate numbers - I just can't _see_ them!.

## Track record
My ranking placements and final times for puzzle 1 and 2 by days.<br >
**Others** is number of solvers of both puzzles and **Just 1** of those who had solved
only the first one, taken from
[global stats](https://adventofcode.com/2021/stats) when I completed.
